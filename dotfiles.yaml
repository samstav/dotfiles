# python's glob module filters files and dirs that start
# with dots, so to glob on those matches you will need
# to use a pattern like this:
#
# links:
#    <target>: <source>
#    ~/:       configs/.*
#
# globbing, tildes, and environment variables are allowed
# in the source values, e.g.
#
# links:
#     # This will link contents of vim/ into ~/.vim
#     # Again, mind the leading dot, needs to be explicit
#     ~/.vim: configs/vim/*
#     ~/.vim: configs/vim/.*
#
# environment variables, tildes (but no globbing)
# are allowed in the targets. globbing is only
# allowed in the source value (for creating a link
# for every file in a dir into a target dir as we did above)
#
# links:
#     $HOME/.alink:  configs/$LINKS/alink
#     $HOME/.links/: moar/$LINKS/*
